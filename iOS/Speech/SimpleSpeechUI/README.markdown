# SimpleSpeechUI example app for AT&T Speech SDK

This sample app includes source code and an Xcode project to show how to call the AT&T Speech SDK from an application that wants a custom speech UI.  The app displays a simple client-side mashup.  Pressing a button initiates a speech interaction, a text area shows the recognition result, and a web view uses the recognized speech to search a website.  The text area also shows the progress of the speech interaction, and the button changes to "stop" or "cancel" during the phases of the interaction.

## Setting up the project

The SimpleSpeechUI Xcode project is already configured to link with the Speech SDK, but it needs a copy of the files from the Speech SDK distribution.  Follow these steps to add the latest SpeechKit to the project.

1. Unzip the AT&T Speech SDK into its own folder.
2. Copy the files `ATTSpeechKit.a` and `ATTSpeechKit.h` into the `ATTSpeechKit` subfolder of this sample app.
3. Open the SimpleSpeechUI Xcode project.
4. Expand the `ATTSpeechKit` group within the project window.  Both files should appear in black text, not red (which would indicate that Xcode can't find them).

## Running the sample

Before building the sample app, you will need to add the configuration for your Speech API account: the URL of the service, your application's API key and API secret.  Set those values in `SpeechConfig.m`.   Before distributing your app to the public, make sure you add code to obfuscate those credentials.

## Understanding the speech code

The main code of the sample app is in the `SimpleSpeechViewController` class.  Look in the `-[prepareSpeech]` and `-[listen:]` methods for examples of setting up and starting a speech interaction.  Look in the `-[speechServiceSucceeded:]` and `[speechService:failedWithError:]` methods for examples of handling recognition responses.  Look in `[buttonPressed:]`, `[speechService:willEnterState:]` and `[speechService:audioLevel:]` for examples of handling SpeechKit callbacks for a custom UI.

## Reusable OAuth code

The SpeechAuth class provides example code for authenticating your application with the OAuth client credentials protocol.  It performs an asynchronous network request for an OAuth access token that can be used in the Speech API.  Look in `-[SimpleSpeechViewController prepareSpeech]` for examples of calling SpeechAuth to obtain an access token.
