# SimpleSpeech example app for AT&T Android SpeechKit

This sample app includes source code and an Eclipse project to show how to call the AT&T Android SpeechKit from an application.  The app displays a simple client-side mashup.  Pressing a button initiates a speech interaction, a text area shows the recognition result, and a web view uses the recognized speech to search a website.

## Setting up the project

The SimpleSpeech Eclipse project is already configured to link with SpeechKit, but it needs a copy of the files from the SpeechKit distribution.  Follow these steps to add the latest SpeechKit to the project.

1. If it's not present, create a `libs` subdirectory of this sample app.
2. Unzip the AT&T Android SpeechKit SDK into its own folder.
2. Copy the file `ATTSpeechKit.jar` into the `libs` subfolder.
4. Expand the `libs` group within the Eclipse project window.  You should see the ATTSpeechKit JAR there.

## Running the sample

Before building the sample app, you will need to add the configuration for your Speech API account: the URL of the service, your developer ID, and its password.  Set those values in `SpeechConfig.java`.  Before distributing your app to the public, make sure you add code to obfuscate those credentials.

## Understanding the sample

The main code of the sample app is in the SimpleSpeechActivityDemo and SimpleSpeechServiceDemo class.  Look in the `startSpeechActivity` and `startSpeechService` methods for examples of setting up and starting a speech interaction.  Look in the `onActivityResult` method and ResultListener/ErrorListener classes for handling recognition responses and errors.

An example of OAuth client credential validation is in the class SpeechAuth.  You may use that class in your own applications, or you can use any other OAuth library.
